            <h2>Godot</h2>
            <p>As part of our Dickinson senior seminar our team is responsible for finding and contributing to real-world FOSS project. We decided to contribute to the FOSS game engine Godot because its a popular project and has an active community. Our main contributions thus far are related to bugs that we have solved from the issue tracker. </p>

            <h2>Sesame</h2>
            <p>Sesame was a project I created in one semester as a high school senior, as a result of an individual study project. The goal of this faux product was to create an application for physically disabled individuals to open their house doors remotely without assistance.</p>
